- **Automated Testing:** Lint, unit tests, security scans
- **Image Building:** Multi-stage Docker builds
- **Environment Deployment:** Automatic deployment to environments
- **Health Checks:** Post-deployment validation
- **Notifications:** Slack notifications for deployment status

### Pipeline Triggers

| Trigger | Environment | Actions |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Push to `develop` | Development | Build, test, deploy |
| Push to `staging` | Staging | Build, test, deploy, integration tests |
| Release creation | Production | Build, test, deploy to K8s, smoke tests |
| Pull request | None | Build, test only |

### Required Secrets

Configure these secrets in your GitHub repository:

```bash
# Container registry
GITHUB_TOKEN

# Environment configurations
STAGING_DATABASE_URL
STAGING_JWT_SECRET
PROD_DATABASE_URL
PROD_JWT_SECRET

# Kubernetes access
KUBE_CONFIG

# Monitoring
METRICS_ENDPOINT
METRICS_TOKEN

```

## üìä Monitoring and Health Checks

### Health Check Endpoints

Each service provides health check endpoints:

| Service | Development | Production |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| API Gateway | http://localhost:8000/health | https://api.coffee-export.com/health |
| Frontend | http://localhost:3000 | https://app.coffee-export.com |
| Validators | http://localhost:808X/health | https://validator.coffee-export.com/health |

### Monitoring Stack

#### Prometheus Metrics
- **Endpoint:** http://localhost:9090
- **Metrics:** HTTP requests, response times, error rates
- **Alerts:** CPU, memory, disk usage thresholds

#### Grafana Dashboards
- **Endpoint:** http://localhost:3001
- **Dashboards:** System overview, service health, business metrics
- **Alerts:** Integration with Prometheus alerting

#### Log Aggregation
- **Development:** Console logs with structured JSON
- **Production:** ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
- **Retention:** 30 days development, 90 days production

### Health Check Automation

```bash
# Continuous monitoring
./deploy/health-check.sh monitor --interval 60

# Automated reports
./deploy/health-check.sh report > daily-health-report.md

# Integration with monitoring
./deploy/health-check.sh --format prometheus > /var/lib/prometheus/health-metrics.prom
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Services Not Starting
```bash
# Check container logs
docker logs <container_name>

# Check resource usage
docker stats

# Verify network connectivity
docker network ls
```

#### 2. Health Check Failures
```bash
# Check service status
./deploy/health-check.sh --verbose

# Check individual service
curl -v http://localhost:8000/health

# Check logs for errors
./deploy/deploy.sh logs api-gateway
```

#### 3. Blockchain Network Issues
```bash
# Check peer status
docker exec cli peer channel list

# Check chaincode status
docker exec cli peer chaincode list --installed

# Regenerate crypto materials
./network/scripts/organizations/generate_crypto.sh
```

#### 4. Frontend Build Issues
```bash
# Clear cache and rebuild
cd frontend
npm cache clean --force
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
npm run build
```

### Debug Mode

Enable debug mode for detailed troubleshooting:

```bash
# Deployment debug
./deploy/deploy.sh --verbose --dry-run

# Health check debug
./deploy/health-check.sh --verbose

# Container debug
docker-compose logs -f <service_name>
```

### Log Analysis

```bash
# View deployment logs
tail -f logs/deployment-*.log

# Search for errors
grep -i error logs/deployment-*.log

# Filter by service
grep "api-gateway" logs/deployment-*.log
```

## üîí Security Considerations

### Development Environment
- Default credentials for databases
- HTTP-only communication
- Debug mode enabled
- Mock validators available

### Production Environment
- Strong passwords and certificates required
- HTTPS-only communication
- Security headers enabled
- Real validator integrations
- Network policies in Kubernetes
- Regular security scans

### Security Checklist

- [ ] Strong passwords for all services
- [ ] SSL/TLS certificates configured
- [ ] Security headers enabled
- [ ] Network policies applied
- [ ] Container images scanned for vulnerabilities
- [ ] Access controls configured
- [ ] Audit logging enabled
- [ ] Backup encryption configured

## üìà Performance Optimization

### Resource Allocation

#### Development
```yaml
api-gateway:
  memory: 256Mi
  cpu: 100m

frontend:
  memory: 128Mi
  cpu: 50m
```

#### Production
```yaml
api-gateway:
  memory: 1Gi
  cpu: 500m
  replicas: 3

frontend:
  memory: 512Mi
  cpu: 250m
  replicas: 3
```

### Scaling Guidelines

1. **Monitor resource usage** before scaling
2. **Scale horizontally** for stateless services
3. **Use auto-scaling** in production
4. **Monitor response times** after scaling
5. **Update resource requests/limits** based on usage

### Performance Monitoring

```bash
# Resource usage
kubectl top pods -n coffee-export

# Application metrics
curl http://localhost:8000/metrics

# Load testing
k6 run deploy/tests/performance-test.js
```

## üîÑ Backup and Recovery

### Automated Backups

Production environment includes automated backup:

```bash
# Database backups (daily)
# Log backups (weekly)  
# Configuration backups (on change)
# Certificate backups (monthly)
```

### Manual Backup

```bash
# Database backup
docker exec mongodb mongodump --out=/backup

# Configuration backup
tar -czf config-backup.tar.gz deploy/environments/

# Container volumes backup
docker run --rm -v coffee_data:/data -v $(pwd):/backup ubuntu tar czf /backup/volumes-backup.tar.gz /data
```

### Disaster Recovery

1. **Restore from backup:**
   ```bash
   # Restore database
   docker exec mongodb mongorestore /backup
   
   # Restore configuration
   tar -xzf config-backup.tar.gz
   
   # Redeploy services
   ./deploy/deploy.sh --environment production
   ```

2. **Verify recovery:**
   ```bash
   ./deploy/health-check.sh --environment production
   ```
