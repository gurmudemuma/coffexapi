# Organization-Specific Activity Filtering Implementation

## Overview

This document details the implementation of organization-specific activity filtering in the Coffee Export Platform. The solution ensures that each organization only sees activities and data that are specifically intended for them, preventing information leakage and maintaining clear organizational boundaries.

## Key Implementation Strategies

### 1. API-Level Filtering

All dashboard components fetch data through organization-specific API endpoints with proper headers:

```typescript
const response = await fetch(`http://localhost:8000/api/nbe-stats?org=national-bank`, {
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'X-Organization': 'national-bank',
    'X-User-Role': user?.role || '',
  }
});
```

### 2. Backend Validation

The backend validates:
- User authentication
- Organization membership
- Role authorization
- Returns only organization-specific data

### 3. Frontend Data Validation

After receiving data from the API, components perform additional validation:

```typescript
// Validate that all returned documents are for our organization's document type
// AND belong to our organization
const validDocuments = data.data.pendingApprovals?.filter((item: any) => {
  const isValidDocType = item.docType === config.documentTypes[0];
  const isOrgSpecific = item.organizationOnly === true;
  const isCorrectOrganization = item.organization === config.name || !item.organization;
  
  return isValidDocType && isOrgSpecific && isCorrectOrganization;
}) || [];
```

### 4. Access Control Validation

Each component validates user access before rendering:

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (!user) {
    setAccessError('User authentication required');
    return;
  }

  // Validate user's organization matches the component's organization type
  const userOrgMap: Record<string, string> = {
    'National Bank of Ethiopia': 'national-bank',
    'Customs Authority': 'customs',
    'Coffee Quality Authority': 'quality-authority',
    'Exporter Bank': 'exporter-bank',
    'Commercial Bank of Ethiopia': 'exporter-bank'
  };

  const expectedOrgType = userOrgMap[user.organization];
  if (expectedOrgType !== organizationType) {
    setAccessError(`Access denied: User organization '${user.organization}' not authorized for '${config.name}' operations`);
    return;
  }

  // Validate user's role is authorized for this organization
  if (!config.validRoles.includes(user.role)) {
    setAccessError(`Access denied: Role '${user.role}' not authorized for ${config.name}. Valid roles: ${config.validRoles.join(', ')}`);
    return;
  }

  setAccessError(null);
}, [user, organizationType, config]);
```

## Component-Specific Implementations

### NBEDashboard.tsx

- Fetches data from NBE-specific API endpoint
- Validates user belongs to National Bank of Ethiopia
- Shows empty stats for unauthorized users
- Applies NBE-specific branding

### QualityDashboard.tsx

- Fetches data from Quality Authority-specific API endpoint
- Validates user belongs to Coffee Quality Authority
- Shows empty stats for unauthorized users
- Applies Quality Authority-specific branding

### CustomsDashboard.tsx

- Fetches data from Customs Authority-specific API endpoint
- Validates user belongs to Customs Authority
- Shows empty stats for unauthorized users
- Applies Customs Authority-specific branding

### BankDashboard.tsx

- Fetches data from Bank-specific API endpoint
- Validates user belongs to Exporter Bank or Commercial Bank of Ethiopia
- Shows empty stats for unauthorized users
- Applies Bank-specific branding

### ExporterDashboard.tsx

- Filters exports to only show those belonging to the current user
- Validates user belongs to Coffee Exporters Association
- Validates user has EXPORTER role
- Applies Exporter-specific branding

### ApproversPanel.tsx

- Validates user organization and role
- Filters documents by document type and organization
- Shows access denied message for unauthorized users
- Applies organization-specific branding

## Security Measures

### 1. Multi-Layer Validation

1. **Authentication**: User must be logged in
2. **Organization**: User must belong to the correct organization
3. **Role**: User must have the correct role for the organization
4. **Data**: API returns only data for the specific organization
5. **Frontend Validation**: Additional client-side filtering

### 2. Fallback Security

When API calls fail or return invalid data:
```typescript
if (user?.organization === 'National Bank of Ethiopia') {
  // Provide NBE-specific mock data
} else {
  // Provide empty stats for security
  setStats({
    totalLicenses: 0,
    activeLicenses: 0,
    // ... all other stats set to 0
  });
}
```

### 3. Access Denied Handling

Unauthorized access attempts display clear error messages:
```typescript
if (expectedOrgType !== organizationType) {
  setAccessError(`Access denied: User organization '${user.organization}' not authorized for '${config.name}' operations`);
  return;
}
```

## Data Filtering Techniques

### 1. Document Type Filtering

Each organization only receives documents of their specific type:
- National Bank: LICENSE documents
- Customs Authority: SHIPPING documents
- Quality Authority: QUALITY documents
- Exporter Bank: INVOICE documents

### 2. Organization Flag Filtering

Documents include an `organizationOnly` flag to ensure they're only shown to the intended organization:
```typescript
const isOrgSpecific = item.organizationOnly === true;
```

### 3. Organization Name Filtering

Documents include an `organization` field to ensure they belong to the correct organization:
```typescript
const isCorrectOrganization = item.organization === config.name || !item.organization;
```

## Benefits

1. **Complete Data Isolation**: Each organization can only access their designated data
2. **Cross-Organization Prevention**: Active detection and blocking of unauthorized access attempts
3. **Role-Based Restrictions**: Multi-layer validation ensures proper access control
4. **Fallback Security**: Even in error states, organizations cannot see other organizations' data
5. **Clear Organization Boundaries**: Users only see relevant functionality and data
6. **Enhanced User Experience**: Simplified interfaces showing only applicable features

## Testing and Validation

### Security Testing Scenarios

1. **Cross-Organization Access Tests**: Verify users cannot access other organizations' dashboards
2. **Data Isolation Tests**: Confirm users only see their organization's data
3. **Role Violation Tests**: Ensure role-based access control is enforced
4. **Fallback Data Tests**: Validate that unauthorized users see empty data rather than other organizations' data

### Manual Testing Guide

1. Login as different organization users
2. Attempt to access restricted routes
3. Verify proper error messages and logging
4. Confirm data isolation in dashboards
5. Test alert and notification filtering

## Conclusion

The implemented organization-specific activity filtering system provides comprehensive security boundaries while maintaining usability and performance. Each network member is strictly limited to their designated tasks and data, with full audit trails for compliance and security monitoring.

The multi-layered validation approach ensures robust security against unauthorized access attempts while providing a seamless experience for authorized users. The modular design allows for easy maintenance and extension, making it simple to add new organizations with proper access controls.
