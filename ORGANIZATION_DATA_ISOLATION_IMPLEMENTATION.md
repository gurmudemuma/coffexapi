# Organization-Specific Data Isolation Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive implementation of organization-specific data isolation throughout the Coffee Export Platform. The enhancements ensure that each network member (organization) can only access their designated tasks, resources, and data, maintaining strict security boundaries.

## Implementation Summary

### üõ†Ô∏è Backend Enhancements

#### 1. API Gateway Organization Middleware (`api-gateway/main.go`)

**Key Changes:**
- **Organization Configuration Mapping**: Added comprehensive configuration for all network organizations including MSP IDs, valid roles, and allowed endpoints
- **Organization-Specific Middleware**: New `organizationMiddleware` validates organization access to endpoints before processing requests
- **Enhanced API Route Protection**: Organization-specific routes now require proper organization credentials and role validation
- **Comprehensive Audit Logging**: All organization access attempts are logged with detailed context

**Features:**
```go
// Organization configuration with MSP mapping and role validation
var ORGANIZATION_CONFIG = map[string]OrganizationConfig{
    "national-bank": {
        Name: "National Bank of Ethiopia",
        MSP: "NationalBankMSP", 
        DocumentType: "LICENSE",
        ValidRoles: []string{"NBE_ADMIN", "NBE_OFFICER"},
        APIEndpoints: []string{"/api/pending-approvals", "/api/completed-approvals"}
    },
    // ... additional organizations
}
```

#### 2. Enhanced Approval Handlers

**Key Changes:**
- **Organization Context Validation**: All approval handlers now extract and validate organization context from middleware
- **Document Type Filtering**: Only documents relevant to the organization's responsibility are returned
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Additional validation ensures user roles match organization requirements
- **Data Scope Indicators**: Response includes explicit flags indicating organization-specific data scope

**Security Features:**
- Organization-specific document filtering (LICENSE for NBE, INVOICE for banks, etc.)
- Cross-organization data prevention
- Enhanced audit logging with organization context
- Explicit data isolation indicators in API responses

### üé® Frontend Enhancements

#### 1. ApproversPanel Component (`components/ApproversPanel.tsx`)

**Key Changes:**
- **Organization Access Validation**: Validates user's organization and role against component requirements
- **Enhanced API Integration**: Uses organization-specific headers for backend validation
- **Data Filtering**: Multiple layers of filtering ensure only organization-relevant documents are displayed
- **Access Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for unauthorized access attempts

**Security Features:**
```typescript
// Organization-specific access validation
const userOrgMap: Record<string, string> = {
    'National Bank of Ethiopia': 'national-bank',
    'Customs Authority': 'customs',
    'Coffee Quality Authority': 'quality-authority',
    'Exporter Bank': 'exporter-bank'
};

// Validate user's organization matches component's organization type
if (expectedOrgType !== organizationType) {
    setAccessError(`Access denied: User organization '${user.organization}' not authorized`);
    return;
}
```

#### 2. ExporterDashboard Component (`pages/ExporterDashboard.tsx`)

**Key Changes:**
- **User-Specific Data Filtering**: Exporters can only view their own export requests
- **Organization Validation**: Strict validation ensures only Coffee Exporters Association members can access
- **Enhanced Security Headers**: Visual indicators showing organization-specific access and user context
- **Access Error Display**: Comprehensive error handling for unauthorized access attempts

**Security Features:**
- Filter exports by `exporterId` to ensure data isolation
- Organization and role validation on component mount
- Security-focused UI indicators
- Detailed access violation logging

#### 3. ProtectedRoute Component (`components/ProtectedRoute.tsx`)

**Key Changes:**
- **Enhanced Cross-Organization Detection**: Specific detection and blocking of attempts to access other organization's dashboards
- **Critical Security Logging**: Additional logging for potential security violations
- **Improved Error Messages**: More detailed error messages with incident logging information
- **Multi-Layer Validation**: Organization ‚Üí Role ‚Üí Permission validation chain

**Security Features:**
```typescript
// Enhanced validation: Detect cross-organization dashboard access attempts
const isAttemptingCrossOrgAccess = [
    '/nbe',
    '/customs', 
    '/quality',
    '/bank',
    '/exporter'
].some(orgRoute => currentPath.startsWith(orgRoute)) && !isRouteAllowed;

if (isAttemptingCrossOrgAccess) {
    // Critical security violation logging
    console.warn(`SECURITY ALERT: Cross-organization access attempt`, {
        userId: user.id,
        userOrg: user.organization,
        attemptedPath: currentPath,
        severity: 'CRITICAL'
    });
}
```

## Configuration Management

### Adding New Organizations

1. **API Gateway** (`api-gateway/main.go`):
   ```go
   "new-org": {
       Name: "New Organization Name",
       MSP: "NewOrgMSP",
       DocumentType: "NEW_DOC_TYPE",
       ValidRoles: []string{"NEW_ROLE"},
       APIEndpoints: []string{"/api/new-org-endpoints"}
   }
   ```

2. **Frontend Routes** (`components/ProtectedRoute.tsx`):
   ```typescript
   'New Organization Name': [
       '/new-org-dashboard',
       '/new-org-specific-routes'
   ]
   ```

3. **Navigation** (`components/layout/ModernLayout.tsx`):
   ```typescript
   'New Organization Name': [
       { id: 'new-org-dashboard', label: 'Dashboard', href: '/new-org-dashboard' }
   ]
   ```

### Modifying Permissions

1. Update organization configuration in API Gateway
2. Modify route mappings in ProtectedRoute component
3. Update navigation items for organization
4. Add organization-specific dashboard component if needed

## Testing and Validation

### Security Testing Scenarios

1. **Cross-Organization Access Tests**:
   - NBE user attempting to access Customs dashboard
   - Exporter trying to access validation panels
   - Role violations within organizations

2. **Data Isolation Tests**:
   - Verify users only see their organization's data
   - Confirm API responses are filtered properly
   - Test export request filtering by user

3. **Audit Logging Tests**:
   - Verify all access violations are logged
   - Confirm security alerts are triggered
   - Test audit trail completeness

### Manual Testing Guide

1. **Login as different organization users**
2. **Attempt to access restricted routes**
3. **Verify proper error messages and logging**
4. **Confirm data isolation in dashboards**
5. **Test approval panel organization filtering**

## Conclusion

The implemented organization-specific data isolation system provides comprehensive security boundaries while maintaining usability and performance. Each network member is strictly limited to their designated tasks and data, with full audit trails for compliance and security monitoring.

The modular design allows for easy maintenance and extension, while the multi-layered validation ensures robust security against unauthorized access attempts. This implementation successfully addresses the requirement that "every organization must only see their concerned activities and data."
